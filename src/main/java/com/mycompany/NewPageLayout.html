<h1>Child page</h1>

DON'T get disturbed by this content, it's usually in examples only to confuse you
(or, to remind you that the child page file will be previewable in browser).
*** Everything outside "wicket:extend" will be ignored. ***
<p>Child Page</p>

  <wicket:extend>
  <h2>News</h2>
  So this is the real content to be included into the base page.

  Here we have some component container:

  <div wicket:id="news">Works like usual, so this will be replaced by the component's stuff.</div>

  </wicket:extend>

    *** Again, everything outside the wicket:extend is ignored. ***

    <div>(c) 2010 Ondra.Zizka.cz</div>
